# Examproject-programming

We have chosen project 2D - Lindemayer systems

exact_functions.py is for the functions described in the exam pdf. These have to be precise.

It is possible to define ones own system
Here, you can only use capital letters for denoting the turtle to either draw a line, or rotate some angle

You can also use [ for saving a position, and ] for reurning to the most recently saved position

You can then specify which letters should denote the drawing of a line or rotation of some angle as well as the size of this angle

The system can then be saved for later

# Predefined systems

There are som predefined systems which have been loaded at an earlier point.
Some cannot handle as many iterations, fo rinstance fractal tree, which shouldnt be run at more than 6 iterations unless you have a powerhouse of acomputer, but looks really cool
